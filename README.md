# iris-classification-ml
Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their physical characteristics. It utilizes the well-known Iris dataset, which includes measurements of culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, and body mass. The model is built using a Random Forest classifier and provides a web interface for users to input data and receive predictions.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Iris-Species-Classification.git
cd Iris-Species-Classification
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source .venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Input the Iris flower measurements and click on the "Predict Species" button to see the results.

Model Training
The model is trained using the Random Forest classifier on the Iris dataset. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure that only the relevant features are used for prediction. The model is serialized using Joblib for efficient storage and loading.

Deployment
This application can be deployed using platforms like Heroku or any cloud provider that supports Python applications. Ensure that all dependencies are properly listed in the requirements.txt file for deployment.

Sample Input Data
Refer to the Sample Input Data section for example measurements to test the application.
